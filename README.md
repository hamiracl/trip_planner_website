# trip_planner_website
group trip planner website (in progress)
A python and flask based website that could be used to plan trips. The current iteration has a login and sessions, 
the ability to join and create groups using group IDs, post to these groups, and storage in local SQLite database. 
Currently, this is useful as a messageboard for people in a group and has no trip planner abilities yet.

Limitations:
Can only see the most recent posts in the group (easy fix)
Group IDs are used to join groups instead of passwords (easy fix)
Lack of features beyond the bare bones (hard)
No CSS or Javascript on the front end (hard)
The other person supposed to work on this doesn't do anything
